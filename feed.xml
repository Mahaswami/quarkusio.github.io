                We just started the candidate release cycle for 2.0.0.Final. Feedback is very welcome so if you have a Quarkus app around, please give it a go.

                Unfortunately, 1.13.5.Final introduced a regression in the Hibernate Validator extension due to a Jandex issue (Jandex is our library indexing the classes and annotations). Thus, we released 1.13.6.Final today to mitigate the issue. 1.13.6.Final is a safe upgrade for everyone using Quarkus 1.13. Please also check out the 1.13.5 announcement...

                It is with a bit of emotion that I announce today the release of Quarkus 2.0.0.Alpha1. As previously presented, Quarkus 2.0 is in the continuity of Quarkus 1.x and won&#8217;t require too many changes on your side. But we consider it a major release as major parts of our infrastructure...

                From time to time, I see tweets or articles claiming they don&#8217;t see the point of Quarkus because "who needs fast startup?", "I have plenty of memory" or "what is the point of live reload?". I could write an article debunking these arguments and explain how the latter makes your...
